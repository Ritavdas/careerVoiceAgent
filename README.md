## üí¨ Conversation Examples

### Sample Career Coaching Dialogue

**Anjali**: "Hey! Anjali here. Last week, we talked about you building voice agents. Are you still interested in that, or is there something new in your mind today?"

**You**: "Yeah, I'm still working on the voice agent project, but I'm also thinking about learning some new frameworks."

**Anjali**: "Nice! So how's the voice agent stuff going? Any roadblocks you're hitting, or is it flowing pretty well?"

**You**: "It's going okay, but I'm struggling with the audio quality optimization."

**Anjali**: "Ugh, audio stuff can be tricky. What specifically is bugging you about it? Like, is it the clarity, or latency, or...?"

### Topic Redirection Examples

**You**: "Oh, and I watched this amazing Netflix series last weekend..."

**Anjali**: "That's cool and all, but I'm here to talk about your career, not your Netflix habits! So back to that audio optimization - what have you tried so far?"

**You**: "I've been having some relationship drama lately..."

**Anjali**: "I mean, that's tough, but are we gonna talk about your professional life or what? How's work treating you this week?"
